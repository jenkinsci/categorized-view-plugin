# Changelog

## Version 1.10

- Thanks to GitHub's dcendents PR, the plugin has been fixed to be compatible with Pipeline jobs.

## Version 1.9

After a long time, I'm finally releasing a new version with a couple of changes.

- It's now possible to choose whether the jobs should be grouped by "Display Name" instead of their internal names
- You can specify a regex to exclude jobs from "status computing". That is, if a job is broken, but its **actual name** (not display name) matches the regex, it won't affect the group status.
